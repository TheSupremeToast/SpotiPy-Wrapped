# SpotiPy-Wrapped
This is a notebook I made as a personal project to make sense of the data obtained when requesting personal data from Spotify.  

To get your own personal data go to spotify.com -> account -> privacy -> request data  

I am in the process of converting all the functions to separate files to improve the flow of the notebook file.

If you want to use my script, unzip your data folder into the input folder
